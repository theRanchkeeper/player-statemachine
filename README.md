<h1>
A player statemachine using Godot and GDscript
</h1>

    Happy you're here, this is a statemachine I made on godot. There are a lot of statemachine examples out there<br>
    but I find most of them tideous to work with. Hence I made one on my own after going through a lot of articles and 
    tutorials.
    
    I find this more easy to code and use. This just a small example. I haven't  properly documented the code yet .
    But will do soon.
     
    In case you're lost(really!!??)
    paths to files:
    
     state manager : /scripts/player/player_fsm.gd
     base state : /scripts/player/states/base_state.gd
     
     other states derived from base state can be found in the same directory
